# New List Example App

This app can be run to demonstrate the progress of the new ListControl. It gives you
a grid that you can "reconfigure" in real-time via some buttons at the top.

## Installation

1. Put this app in your workspace.
2. Check out the `mg-lists` branch on ividev.
3. Run `npm install` in ividev.
4. Run `npm run build-sdk` in ividev.
5. Let 'er rip.

## Caveats

* You must test this in Oxygen. CSS has not been ported to Hydrogen, Carbon, or O2 yet.

## TODO

* "page dots" control (alternative to scrollbar)
* Data chunking (lazy-loading)
* Other profile CSS implementations
* Refactoring legacy controls to use this component
* Cucumber coverage
